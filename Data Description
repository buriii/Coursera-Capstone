This file would be presenting the data used for this machine learning project. The data was obtained from Seattle City Geo Data. The data records all types of 
collisions from year 2004 to Present. Collisions are displayed at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. The data contains speed, light condition, road 
condition etc. The purpose of the project is to use machine learning to predict the severity of an accident based on the datasets that was given. The dataset 
"Data-Collisions.csv" was provided by SDOT GIS.
